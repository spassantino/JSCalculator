JS Calculator

Introduction

I have just spent a week learning JavaScript and JQuery syntax, and have been given an introduction to how JavaScript is used in the browser. This calculator project was completed to apply my skills and get some experience using JavaScript to create a user interface.

Overview

I have created a calculator with JavaScript. My calculator is added to the DOM on page load entirely with JavaScript (I didn't type any HTML to represent the calculator, except for one permitted div container).

Minimum Requirements

[ ]: The calculator has a screen which displays numbers input by the user, or a summed total based on mathematical operations

[ ]: The calculator has buttons (0-9, +, -, /, *, ., =, C)

[ ]: The calculator can perform the following operations (i.e. is a working calculator:

addition
subtraction
division
multiplication
[ ]: The 'C' button clears the running total/entered value (works like a clear button).

[ ]: = returns the sum of the current operation

[ ]: All calculator buttons are assigned click events which result in some action being performed (be it updating the displayed value, or performing math)

Stretch Goals

[ ]: Handles decimals

[ ]: Users can enter values/perform math with keyboard input (keypress)
